## Introduction

**JsonTransform** is a JSON flow (REST, ...) with strong focus on preserving original flow schema/structure/semantic.
It is heavily inspired with  and [XPath](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/xpath#w3c_all), and its JSON/JS equivalent [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/), but rather acting rather as an interceptor of JSON flow communication with on-the-fly support for filtering and semantic restructuring of underlying JSON dataset
Surely it can be used on vanilla JSON objects, but that is not of our main interest.



## WHY
Here are some reasons for creationg JsonTransform

* Support for **on-the-fly** interception and modification of a JSON flow
    * filtering
    * schema/semantic/structure modification
    * on-the-fly REST API addaptation
    * itercepting and observing dataflow
    * triggering side actions on dataflow triggers

### Nice to have features?
